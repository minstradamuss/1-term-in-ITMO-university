# 1 term in ITMO-university
Doing shit or doing almost nothing in M3135.
Or just my working days.


A brief tour of the subjects:
1. Mathematical analysis - very little practice, but a lot of bare theory needs to be taught, in terms of here it is more important not to be able to apply, but it is better to memorize the proof of one theorem on 2 sheets;
2. Linear algebra is an interesting subject, I really liked it;
3. Discrete mathematics - cancellation of lectures (instead of them they offered to look at the records on YouTube of other years) is very bad, incomprehensible and inadequate assessment (the system of basic and bonus points is the nonsense of the teacher);
4. Algorithms and data structures are the best and favorite subject - useful, interesting, only thanks to this course I passed the first interview in my life;
5. Computer architecture - perhaps this course is needed for general development, but to score with a Verilog your free time... in general, if you want to become a sysadmin, you do not need to spend 4 years of training on it;
6. Introduction to programming - a course in Java, in general, everything related to programming is taught only in Java, i.e. if you want to work only as Java developers, you are here, also this is due to the fact that there is one teacher who writes only in this language and whom it's time to change to a younger generation of teachers;
7. English is very weak, topics are covered: rare animals, sports, character description, i.e. about the time complexity of algorithms, what I needed at the interview, you will not be able to speak freely
8. Digital culture is the most important course in the opinion of all teachers, which is presented as necessary for future work, in fact it is unnecessary shit that you will spend a lot of time on and during the internship you, like me, will not need anything from this course.

Also, this fact: if you cheated, or your programs accidentally matched, such as 2 numbers are given at the input, you need to withdraw their sum, then ... Stankevich will place you in the legendary "red folder" that no one has seen and check its existence no possibility. If you get into this folder, then the whole CT hat will fly at you, because. here all the toxics are ready to snitch on each other, they will also promise you that if you need something from the pulpit, you will not get it and all that nonsense. In fact, in principle, there is no possibility to contact the department, because there are no departments here, and there is some kind of structure that no one understands.
They will also promise you that if you want to transfer, then they will write to you in a personal file and recommendation that you wrote off. As a result, in fact, no recommendations are required anywhere. This is only the elevation of the teacher's own importance - this is bad.

As a result, if you want a normal life, a quality education, if you want teachers to answer your questions in a chat, and not write: "Your question has been ignored", then DO NOT go to ITMO, go to some classical university.

Good luck!
