# ITMO-university
My adventures in ITMO university in M3135...
Cool students but poor teaching or how I wasted an entire semester...
I advise you to think before coming here, because most of the reviews on the Internet turned out to be true. 
PR is more important than the quality of education here.

At ICPC and NEERC, ITMO consistently loses to HSE and St. Petersburg State University, as well as the last result at ICPC - 19th place. I think this can be considered a good indicator of education here, and an indicator of which way this education is rolling
