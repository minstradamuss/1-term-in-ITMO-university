# ITMO-university
My adventures in ITMO university in M3135...
Cool students but poor teaching (especially discrete mathematics and algorithms) or how I wasted an entire semester...
I advise you to think before coming here, because most of the reviews on the Internet turned out to be true. 
PR is more important than the quality of education here.
